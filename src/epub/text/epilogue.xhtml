								<br/>
								<span>To my interpretation of the scene.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I rise to give your fancy comprehension,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And analyze the parts of the machine.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My mood is such that I would not deceive you,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though still a liar and the father of it,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From judgment’s frailty I would retrieve you,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though falsehood is my art and though I love it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Down in the habitations whence I rise,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The roots of human sorrow boundless spread.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Long have I watched them draw the strength that lies</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In clay made richer by the rotting dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Here is a blossom, here a twisted stalk,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Here fruit that sourly withers ere its prime;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And here a growth that sprawls across the walk,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Food for the green worm, which it turns to slime.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The ruddy apple with a core of cork</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Springs from a root which in a hollow dangles,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not skillful husbandry nor laborious work</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can save the tree which lightning breaks and tangles.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why does the bright nasturtium scarcely flower</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But that those insects multiply and grow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which make it food, and in the very hour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In which the veined leaves and blossoms blow?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why does a goodly tree, while fast maturing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Turn crooked branches covered o’er with scale?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why does the tree whose youth was not assuring</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Prosper and bear while all its fellows fail?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I under earth see much. I know the soil.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I know where mold is heavy and where thin.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I see the stones that thwart the plowman’s toil,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The crooked roots of what the priests call sin.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I know all secrets, even to the core,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What seedlings will be upas, pine or laurel;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It cannot change howe’er the field’s worked o’er.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Man’s what he is and that’s the devil’s moral.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So with the souls of the ensuing drama</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They sprang from certain seed in certain earth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Behold them in the devil’s cyclorama,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shown in their proper light for all they’re worth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now to my task: I’ll give an exhibition</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of mixing the ingredients of spirit.</span>
