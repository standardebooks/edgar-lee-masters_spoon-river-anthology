					<span>One was killed in a brawl,</span>

					<span>One died in a jail,</span>

					<span>All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where are Ella, Kate, Mag, Lizzie and Edith,</span>

					<span>The tender heart, the simple soul, the loud, the proud, the happy one?--</span>

					<span>All, all are sleeping on the hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One died in shameful child-birth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of a thwarted love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One at the hands of a brute in a brothel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of a broken pride, in the search for heart's desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One after life in far-away London and Paris</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag--</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And old Towny Kincaid and Sevigne Houghton,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Major Walker who had talked With venerable men of the revolution?--</span>

					<span>All, all are sleeping on the hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They brought them dead sons from the war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And daughters whom life had crushed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And their children fatherless, crying--</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is Old Fiddler Jones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who played with life all his ninety years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Braving the sleet with bared breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago,</span>
					<br/>
