				<p>
					<span>One died in shameful child-birth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of a thwarted love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One at the hands of a brute in a brothel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of a broken pride, in the search for heart's desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One after life in far-away London and Paris</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag--</span>

					<span>All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily,</span>

					<span>And Major Walker who had talked With venerable men of the revolution?--</span>

				<p>
					<span>They brought them dead sons from the war,</span>

					<span>And their children fatherless, crying--</span>

					<span>All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is Old Fiddler Jones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who played with life all his ninety years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Braving the sleet with bared breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago,</span>

				<span>I belonged to the church,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the party of prohibition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the villagers thought I died of eating watermelon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In truth I had cirrhosis of the liver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For every noon for thirty years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I slipped behind the prescription partition</span>

				<span>In Trainor's drug store</span>

				<span>From the bottle marked</span>

				<span>I ran away from home with the circus,</span>

				<span>The lion tamer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One time, having starved the lions</span>

				<span>I entered the cage and began to beat Brutus</span>

				<span>The earth keeps some vibration going</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in your heart, and that is you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if the people find you can fiddle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, fiddle you must, for all your life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What do you see, a harvest of clover?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a meadow to walk through to the river?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wind's in the corn; you rub your hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For beeves hereafter ready for market;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else you hear the rustle of skirts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the girls when dancing at Little Grove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Cooney Potter a pillar of dust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whirling leaves meant ruinous drouth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They looked to me like Red-Head Sammy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stepping it off, to "Toor-a-Loor."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How could I till my forty acres</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to speak of getting more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a medley of horns, bassoons and piccolos</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stirred in my brain by crows and robins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the creak of a wind-mill--only these?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I never started to plow in my life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That some one did not stop in the road</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And take me away to a dance or picnic.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ended up with forty acres;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ended up with a broken fiddle--</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a broken laugh, and a thousand memories,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not a single regret.</span>

				<span>I was only eight years old;</span>

				<br/>
				<span>I had no words for it, except</span>

				<span>That I was frightened and told my Mother;</span>

				<span>Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>Was a newcomer and never heard it</span>

				<br/>

				<span>I have studied many times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marble which was chiseled for me--</span>

				<span>A boat with a furled sail at rest in a harbor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In truth it pictures not my destination</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But my life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love was offered me and I shrank from its disillusionment;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrow knocked at my door, but I was afraid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambition called to me, but I dreaded the chances.</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>And now I know that we must lift the sail</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>Wherever they drive the boat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To put meaning in one's life may end in madness,</span>

				<span>But life without meaning is the torture</span>
