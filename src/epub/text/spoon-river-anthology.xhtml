				<p>
					<span>One died in shameful child-birth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of a thwarted love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One at the hands of a brute in a brothel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of a broken pride, in the search for heart's desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One after life in far-away London and Paris</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag--</span>

					<span>All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily,</span>

					<span>And Major Walker who had talked With venerable men of the revolution?--</span>

				<p>
					<span>They brought them dead sons from the war,</span>

					<span>And their children fatherless, crying--</span>

					<span>All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is Old Fiddler Jones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who played with life all his ninety years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Braving the sleet with bared breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago,</span>

				<span>Well, don't you see this was the way of it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We bought the farm with what he inherited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his brothers and sisters accused him of poisoning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father's mind against the rest of them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we never had any peace with our treasure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The murrain took the cattle, and the crops failed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lightning struck the granary.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So we mortgaged the farm to keep going.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he grew silent and was worried all the time.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then some of the neighbors refused to speak to us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took sides with his brothers and sisters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I had no place to turn, as one may say to himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At an earlier time in life; "No matter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So and so is my friend, or I can shake this off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a little trip to Decatur."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the dreadfullest smells infested the rooms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So I set fire to the beds and the old witch-house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went up in a roar of flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I danced in the yard with waving arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While he wept like a freezing steer.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>The first thing I saw, right there by the steps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the boys had hacked for angle worms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was the hatchet!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And just as I entered there was my wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Standing before me, big with child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She started the talk of the mortgaged farm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I killed her.</span>

				<span>They first charged me with disorderly conduct,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There being no statute on blasphemy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Later they locked me up as insane</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I was beaten to death by a Catholic guard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My offense was this:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I said God lied to Adam, and destined him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lead the life of a fool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ignorant that there is evil in the world as well as good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when Adam outwitted God by eating the apple</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw through the lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God drove him out of Eden to keep him from taking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fruit of immortal life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Christ's sake, you sensible people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here's what God Himself says about it in the book of Genesis:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"And the Lord God said, behold the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is become as one of us" (a little envy, you see),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"To know good and evil" (The all-is-good lie exposed):</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"And now lest he put forth his hand and take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore the Lord God sent Him forth from the garden of Eden."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The reason I believe God crucified His Own Son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get out of the wretched tangle is, because it sounds just like Him.)</span>

				<span>Everyone laughed at Col. Prichard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For buying an engine so powerful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it wrecked itself, and wrecked the grinder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He ran it with.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But here is a joke of cosmic size:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The urge of nature that made a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evolve from his brain a spiritual life--</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh miracle of the world!--</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The very same brain with which the ape and wolf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Get food and shelter and procreate themselves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature has made man do this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a world where she gives him nothing to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After all-- (though the strength of his soul goes round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a futile waste of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gear itself to the mills of the gods)--</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But get food and shelter and procreate himself!</span>

				<span>All they said was true:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wrecked my father's bank with my loans</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dabble in wheat; but this was true--</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I was buying wheat for him as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who couldn't margin the deal in his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because of his church relationship.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while George Reece was serving his term</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I chased the will-o'-the-wisp of women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mockery of wine in New York.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It's deathly to sicken of wine and women</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When nothing else is left in life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But suppose your head is gray, and bowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a table covered with acrid stubs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of cigarettes and empty glasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a knock is heard, and you know it's the knock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long drowned out by popping corks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the pea-cock screams of demireps--</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you look up, and there's your Theft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who waited until your head was gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And your heart skipped beats to say to you:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The game is ended. I've called for you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go out on Broadway and be run over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They'll ship you back to Spoon River.</span>

				<span>It was just like everything else in life:</span>

				<span>Something outside myself drew me down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My own strength never failed me.</span>
				<br/>

				<span>And I had to give him all of it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just so it went till I ended up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man-of-all-work in Spoon River.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus when I got the water-tower cleaned,</span>

				<span>I unhooked the rope from my waist,</span>
